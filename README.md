# Personal-Blog

A website written to be a personal blog and resume website for myself.

#Features

Will use MongoDB in conjunction with mongoose to store blog entries within the system.  I plan on starting with this, and gradually building upon the website.

At a later point I hope to incorporate a frontend using either Angular or React to make the website more personal, showing off my style and flair.

#Current Progress

At the moment I'm just starting out, but I hope to get the barebones site running very soon!
